USING ZHONG PWA
This is Zhong PWA (Progressive Web Application) for learning Chinese.
How to use:

Fill textbox with any site url.
The source is similiar to (with adaptation): Chrome Extension “Zhongwen: Chinese-English Dictionary”, only this works in Android/iOS phone where web extension only available in desktop.
If you hover every mandarin text with mouse, it will showing English translation in pop-up window.
Please use this tool wisely.
For Desktop environment (Chrome/Firefox Web Browser), it’s better using original tools named Zhongwen.
